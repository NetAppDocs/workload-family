Support registration is required to receive technical support specific to Workload Factory and its storage solutions and services. You must register for support from the BlueXP console, which is a separate web-based console from Workload Factory.

Registering for support does not enable NetApp support for a cloud provider file service. For technical support related to a cloud provider file service, its infrastructure, or any solution using the service, refer to "Getting help" in the Workload Factory documentation for that product.

== Support registration overview

Registering your account ID support subscription (your 20 digit 960xxxxxxxxx serial number located on the Support Resources page in BlueXP) serves as your single support subscription ID. Each BlueXP account-level support subscription must be registered.

Registering enables capabilities like opening support tickets and automatic case generation. Registration is completed by adding NetApp Support Site (NSS) accounts to BlueXP as described below.

== Register your account for NetApp support

To register for support and activate support entitlement, one user in your account must associate a NetApp Support Site account with their BlueXP login. How you register for NetApp support depends on whether you already have a NetApp Support Site (NSS) account.

=== Existing customer with an NSS account

If you're a NetApp customer with an NSS account, you simply need to register for support through BlueXP.

.Steps

. In the upper right of the Workload Factory console, select *Help > Support*.
+
Selecting this option opens the BlueXP console a new browser tab and loads the Support dashboard.

. In the upper right of the BlueXP console, select the Settings icon, and select *Credentials*.

. Select *User Credentials*.

. Select *Add NSS credentials* and follow the NetApp Support Site (NSS) Authentication prompt.

. To confirm that the registration process was successful, select the Help icon, and select *Support*.
+
The *Resources* page should show that your account is registered for support.

+
Note that other BlueXP users will not see this same support registration status if they have not associated a NetApp Support Site account with their BlueXP login. However, that doesn't mean that your BlueXP account is not registered for support. As long as one user in the account has followed these steps, then your account has been registered.

=== Existing customer but no NSS account

If you're an existing NetApp customer with existing licenses and serial numbers but _no_ NSS account, you need to create an NSS account and associate it with your BlueXP login.

.Steps

. Create a NetApp Support Site account by completing the https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/user/registration[NetApp Support Site User Registration form^]

.. Be sure to select the appropriate User Level, which is typically *NetApp Customer/End User*.

.. Be sure to copy the BlueXP account serial number (960xxxx) used above for the serial number field. This will speed up the account processing.

. Associate your new NSS account with your BlueXP login by completing the steps under <<Existing customer with an NSS account>>.
